 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with		
 *      the conditions stated in this License.									
 *																				
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,		
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,		
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a		
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the		
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,		
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all			
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor			
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.					
 *																				
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
